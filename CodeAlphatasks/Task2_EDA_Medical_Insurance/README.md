## Visual Analysis

### 1. Distribution Charts

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riddhi712/CodeAlpha_Data_Analysis_Task_2/main/Distribution%20Charts.png" alt="Distribution Charts" width="600">

**Key Observations from Distribution Analysis:**

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **Mean Medical Cost** | $17,913 | Higher than median due to right skew |
| **Median Medical Cost** | $16,362 | More representative central tendency |
| **Age Distribution** | Uniform (18-65) | Evenly distributed across working ages |
| **BMI Peak** | ~25-30 | Centered in overweight category |
| **Income Floor** | $18,000 | Artificial minimum affecting 3.5% of records |

**Critical Findings:**
- 🚬 **Smoking Impact:** Smokers average **$29,152** vs non-smokers **$15,170** — a **92% increase**
- 🏃 **Exercise Benefit:** High exercise reduces costs by **17.6%** ($19,563 → $16,110)
- 🏥 **Plan Tier Effect:** Gold plans show highest average costs ($23,559), suggesting adverse selection
- 📉 **Chronic Disease Prevalence:** 49.8% have zero chronic diseases; 7 have 5+ conditions

### 2. Correlation Analysis & Bivariate Matrix

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riddhi712/CodeAlpha_Data_Analysis_Task_2/main/Correlation%20Analysis%20and%20Bivariate%20Matrix.png" alt="Correlation Analysis and Bivariate Matrix" width="700">

**Correlation Matrix Insights:**

| Variable Pair | Correlation | Strength | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Smoker × Medical Cost** | **r = 0.73** | **Strong** | 🔥 Dominant cost driver |
| **Chronic Diseases × Cost** | **r = 0.38** | **Moderate** | Key health indicator |
| **Doctor Visits × Cost** | **r = 0.34** | **Moderate** | Utilization drives costs |
| **Hospitalizations × Cost** | **r = 0.24** | **Weak-Moderate** | Acute care impact |
| **Age × Cost** | **r = 0.16** | **Weak** | Age alone not predictive |
| **BMI × Cost** | **r = 0.07** | **Very Weak** | BMI less impactful than expected |
| **Income × Cost** | **r = 0.02** | **Negligible** | Wealth doesn't drive spending |

**Bivariate Scatter Analysis:**
- **Age vs Cost by Smoking:** Clear separation — smokers (red) cluster at higher costs across all ages
- **BMI vs Cost by Exercise:** Exercise level shows minimal cost differentiation at given BMI
- **Chronic Diseases Boxplot:** Dramatic cost escalation with each additional disease (0 diseases: ~$15K → 5 diseases: ~$35K+)

### 3. Advanced Segment Analysis

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riddhi712/CodeAlpha_Data_Analysis_Task_2/main/Advanced%20segment%20analysis.png" alt="Advanced Segment Analysis" width="700">

**Regional & Occupational Insights:**

| Segment | Average Cost | Notable Finding |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Southwest Region** | $18,114 | Highest regional costs |
| **Central Region** | $17,598 | Lowest regional costs |
| **Teachers** | $18,441 | Highest occupational costs |
| **Office Workers** | $17,344 | Lowest occupational costs |
| **Regional Variance** | $516 | Relatively small (2.9%) |
| **Occupational Variance** | $1,097 | Larger (6.3%) |

**Alcohol Consumption Analysis:**
- **0-2 drinks/week:** Baseline cost ~$17,500
- **3-5 drinks/week:** Slight increase to ~$18,000
- **6-10 drinks/week:** Cost decline (counterintuitive — possible healthy user bias)
- **11-15 drinks/week:** Cost stabilization
- **Doctor visits peak** at 3-5 drinks/week, then decline

**Income vs Medical Cost by Insurance Plan:**
- **Flat trend line** (slope = -0.0050) confirms **no income-cost relationship**
- **Premium plans** (yellow) cluster at higher costs regardless of income
- **Basic plans** (green) concentrated at lower cost ranges
- **Adverse selection evident:** Higher-cost individuals gravitate toward Gold/Premium plans

## Key Findings

### Primary Cost Drivers (Ranked by Impact)

| Rank | Factor | Impact | Evidence |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Smoking Status** | **+$13,982 (92%)** | t = 93.3, p < 0.001 |
| 2 | **Chronic Diseases** | **+$20,000+ (5 diseases)** | r = 0.38, p < 0.001 |
| 3 | **Insurance Plan Tier** | **+$7,000 (Gold vs Basic)** | F = 274.7, p < 0.001 |
| 4 | **Doctor Visits** | **+$15,000 (15 visits)** | r = 0.34, p < 0.001 |
| 5 | **Exercise Level** | **-$3,453 (High vs Low)** | Observable difference |
| 6 | **Age** | **+$5,000 (18→65)** | r = 0.16, weak |
| 7 | **BMI** | **Minimal** | r = 0.07, negligible |
| 8 | **Income** | **None** | r = 0.02, p = 0.159 |

### Surprising Discoveries

1. **Income Irrelevance:** Annual income has virtually no correlation with medical costs — healthcare needs are health-driven, not wealth-driven
2. **BMI Weakness:** Despite common assumptions, BMI shows minimal cost correlation (r = 0.07)
3. **Exercise Paradox:** High exercise shows cost reduction, but moderate vs. high exercise differentiation is minimal
4. **Alcohol Non-Linearity:** Alcohol consumption shows non-monotonic cost relationship, suggesting complex health behaviors

## Data Quality

### Issues Identified

| Issue | Severity | Description | Recommendation |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Income Floor** | Medium | 259 records (3.5%) at exactly $18,000 | Flag for income analysis; exclude if modeling |
| **Right-Skewed Costs** | Low | Skewness = 0.858 | Apply log transformation for regression |
| **BMI Boundaries** | Low | Hard limits at 16.0 and 45.0 | Verify against clinical standards |
| **Zero Inflation** | Low | 49.8% zero chronic diseases | Legitimate — use zero-inflated models if needed |
